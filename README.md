### Clone the Repository:
Start by cloning the project's repository to your local machine using Git

### Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Node.js packages by running: npm install

### Set Up MongoDB:
Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally or provide the connection URL to a MongoDB instance in your project's configuration.

### Configure Environment Variables:
If your project uses environment variables to store sensitive information like database connection strings or API keys, create a .env file in the project root directory and set the necessary variables.

### Run the Application:
Start the Node.js server by running:

npm start

This will launch your Express.js application, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

### Test Endpoints:
You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or your web browser to test the API endpoints defined in your project. Here are some sample requests you can make:

GET /products: Retrieve a list of all products.
GET /products/:id: Retrieve a specific product by its ID.
POST /products: Create a new product by sending a POST request with JSON data.
PUT /products/:id: Update an existing product by sending a PUT request with JSON data.
DELETE /products/:id: Delete a product by its ID.
Ensure that you provide valid data and handle the responses appropriately.

### Check the Console:
While your server is running, check the console for any logs or error messages. This is where you'll see server startup messages and potential errors.

### Test Error Handling:
To test error handling, intentionally send requests with incorrect data or to non-existing routes and observe how the application responds with appropriate status codes and error messages.
